# module. One JSON round-trip, bounded in time and in size, refusing
# redirects and ignoring proxies; and the small helpers every store client
# needs.
#
# A port of typescript/plugins/httpjson.ts, which is canonical.
#
# HTTP::Tiny, JSON::PP and MIME::Base64 are all core Perl, so this port
# stays free of third-party dependencies. HTTPS additionally wants
# IO::Socket::SSL, which HTTP::Tiny picks up when it is present: the TLS
# exception AGENTS.md rule 3 records, and the reason a machine without it
# has a Perl port that cannot reach a real vault.
