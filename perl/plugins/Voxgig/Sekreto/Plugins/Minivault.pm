# value that reaches a KDF or a cipher as anything else produces a vault
# none of them can open.
#
# UNCONDITIONALLY, AND NOT ON `utf8::is_utf8`. That flag is an internal
# representation, not a meaning: perl holds the same string of characters
# as Latin-1 bytes or as UTF-8 depending on what has happened to it, and
# `utf8::upgrade` changes it without changing the string. A conversion
# that reads the flag therefore hashes one passphrase two ways, which is
# the defect this replaced. Encoding a copy every time is
# representation-neutral, which is the property that matters, and ASCII -
# every passphrase in the fixtures, and most in the world - is unchanged
# by it.
#
# The cost is the other direction: a scalar that is ALREADY UTF-8 bytes,
# which is what `%ENV` and a file hand back, is encoded twice. So the
# boundary decodes - `cli/sekreto-cli.pl` does it for the three vault
# environment variables - and the library works in characters throughout,

# audited module rather than three of them plus a block cipher written in

# table-driven AES passes every known-answer test in the world and still
# hands its key to anyone who can time a cache.
