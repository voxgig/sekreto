# One HTTP round-trip, framed in-tree over OTP's own sockets.
#
# `:httpc` is in the distribution and is not used. Three of this library's
# rules are not expressible through it: the 8 MiB body bound (httpc
# buffers whatever arrives before the caller sees a byte), the single
# ten-second deadline across connect, send and read, and the guarantee
# that no proxy is consulted - httpc's proxy, cookie and redirect settings
# live on a shared profile that the host application may already have
# configured. So the request line, the headers and the chunked body are
# assembled and read here, over `:gen_tcp` and `:ssl` directly.
#
# Response headers are decoded by OTP's `{:packet, :http_bin}` mode, which
# is part of the runtime rather than a dependency.
#
# TLS is NOT hand-rolled: `:ssl` is OTP's, and it is the audit surface.
#
# The models are rust/src/http.rs and the framing recipe every port
# without a client follows.
