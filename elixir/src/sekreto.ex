# sekreto: one interface for secrets, wherever they live.
#
# A Sekreto is an ordered chain of providers. `get` asks each in turn and
# returns the first hit, so an app can be configured from environment
# variables in development and a vault in production without changing a
# line of its own code.
#
# THE CORE NAMES NO PROVIDER THAT OPENS A SOCKET, SPAWNS A PROCESS OR
# SIGNS A REQUEST. The four built-in kinds - env, memory, dotenv, file -
# read at most a local file; every other kind is a voxgig/plugin
# definition under plugins/, and a chain may name one only if the calling
# project handed it in through `plugins`. See
# docs/design/plugin-providers.md.
#
# A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.

  Build a chain from provider specs, live providers, or a mix of the two.

  Options:

    * `plugins:` - the provider kinds beyond the four built-ins that this
      chain may name. A kind that is not in the list cannot be built, and
      naming one is refused with a message that says so.
    * `cache: false` - turns the read cache off. Only an exact `false`
      does; anything else leaves it on.

  Two spellings, and they mean the same thing. The chain reads naturally
  first:

      Sekreto.new(chain, plugins: [Hashicorp.hashicorp()], cache: false)

  ...and every other port writes one options object, which is what DOCS.md
  documents, so that is accepted too:

      Sekreto.new(plugins: [...], providers: chain)

  One argument is options when it is a non-empty keyword list, and the
  chain otherwise: a chain entry is a `Sekreto.ProviderSpec` or a live
  provider - a struct or a map - and never a `{key, value}` pair, so
  nothing is ambiguous. `Sekreto.new([])` reads as both and means the same
  either way.

  Construction contacts nothing. `load` runs each definition's `define`,
  which builds the provider from its spec, and `activate` takes the
  instance live; the first network call is still the first lookup. A spec
  that cannot be built at all - an unknown kind, an unsupported KV version
  - raises here, in chain order.
