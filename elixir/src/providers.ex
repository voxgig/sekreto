# What a provider is, how a provider kind becomes a voxgig/plugin
# definition - and the four BUILT-IN kinds.
#
# A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
# the value, or nil to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
# provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
# `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
# .env file, HashiCorp Vault, AWS, GCP, Azure or a boru vault.
#
# Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that does
# not hold the secret is a MISS (nil) - the chain carries on. A store that
# could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host, missing
# configuration - is an ERROR: falling through there would quietly reach
# for a weaker store.
#
# THIS MODULE OPENS NO SOCKET, SIGNS NOTHING AND SPAWNS NOTHING. What
# makes a kind built in is that it needs nothing of the platform beyond
# reading a local file; every kind that opens a socket, signs a request or
# spawns a process is a voxgig/plugin definition under plugins/, its own
# module, loaded only by a program that names it. `elixirc` proves it:
# `make check-core` compiles src/ alone, and a call into a module that is
# not there is a warning this repository treats as an error
# (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
#
# A port of typescript/src/provider/support.ts and
# typescript/src/provider/builtin.ts, which are canonical.
