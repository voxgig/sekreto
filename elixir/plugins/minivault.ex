# The mini vault, as a voxgig/plugin definition.
#
# A port of typescript/plugins/minivault.ts, which is canonical.
#
# A PLUGIN, not a built-in: it needs crypto, which is the line the four
# built-ins stay behind. See docs/design/plugin-providers.md.
#
# THE KEY DECIDES WHAT THE VAULT HOLDS. A master key reads and writes
# every name and mints restricted keys. A restricted key reads the names
# it was granted and CANNOT DERIVE ANY OTHER - the restriction is the
# cryptography rather than a check this code performs. What that does and
# does not protect is set out in DOCS.md under "What the mini vault
# protects".
#
# Erlang's `:crypto` carries all four primitives, so nothing here is
# hand-rolled (AGENTS.md rule 3).

defmodule Sekreto.Plugins.Minivault do
  @moduledoc """
  A mini vault: every secret a project owns, encrypted, in ONE FILE.

  The format:

      magic       4   'SKMV'
      version     1   FORMAT
      kdf         1   1 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
      cipher      1   1 = AES-256-GCM
      reserved    1   0
      keycount    4   uint32
      per key:
        id        1 + bytes      the key id, PLAINTEXT
        salt      1 + bytes
        iters     4              PBKDF2 rounds for this key
        ring      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the passphrase
        meta      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's meta key
      entrycount  4   uint32
      per entry:
        id        1 + bytes      the blinded lookup id
        name      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's name key
        value     1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under that secret's own key

  Integers are big-endian, and every length precedes its bytes. A file one
  port writes is read by every other; `test/fixture` pins that with a
  committed vault rather than with agreement.

  THE HANDLE IS A PROCESS. Every other port keeps the derived keys in a
  closure or a field and mutates them; a vault handle here is an Agent,
  because a handle that caches what it derived and a handle that notices a
  revoked key are the same handle, and elixir has no other way to be both.
