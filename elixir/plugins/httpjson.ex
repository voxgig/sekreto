# The round-trip every remote store shares - and OUTSIDE THE CORE with the
# client under it.
#
# Eight of the ten plugin kinds read a vault over HTTPS, and all eight
# want the same three things: one JSON round-trip whose failures are
# never a miss, a login token renewed shortly before its lease runs out,
# and a handful of conversions between a JSON value and the string a
# secret is. Written once here rather than eight times, and never in the
# core: a chain of the four built-ins must not link an HTTP client.
#
# `runcmd` is NOT here. The two kinds that read a store through its own
# CLI - boru and secretspec - reach `Sekreto.Plugins.Proc` instead, so
# that secretspec, which opens no socket at all, loads no socket code.
