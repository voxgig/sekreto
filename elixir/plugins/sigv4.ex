# AWS Signature Version 4, hand-rolled - and OUTSIDE THE CORE, because it
# is the library's one cryptographic edge. Only the two aws kinds sign
# anything, which is why the core of no port imports a hash function:
# `:crypto` is reached from here and from nowhere else.
#
# The AWS providers need exactly one thing from the AWS SDK - request
# signing - and taking the SDK for it would break the no-dependency rule
# that keeps the ports honest. SigV4 is a stable, published algorithm built
# from HMAC-SHA256, which OTP's `:crypto` already has.
#
# `sigv4` is pure: the caller passes the timestamp, so the same input
# yields the same signature everywhere. That is what lets the shared spec
# carry known-answer cases that all ports must reproduce bit-for-bit, and
# lets the integration mock recompute the signature server-side.
#
# THE URL HALF IS NOT HERE. `uriescape`, `uridecode`, `urlhost` and
# `urlparts` live in `Sekreto.Plugins.Http`, because four kinds that sign
# nothing escape a query parameter and the HTTP client itself splits every
# URL it sends. Keeping them here would make every HTTPS kind reach the
# signer, and `:crypto` with it, for a string function. Ruby's port draws
# the same line, into its `httpjson`. The uppercase-hex rule that pairs
# with src/json.ex's lowercase one travelled with `uriescape`; the comment
# on it is there.
#
# A port of typescript/plugins/sigv4.ts, which is canonical.
