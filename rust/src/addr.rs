/// A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
/// convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local
/// machine puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for
/// anyone on the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed:
/// that is `vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own
/// test harness.
///
/// https is dialled by whichever plugin needs it, with the server
/// certificate and the host name both verified and `SEKRETO_CA_BUNDLE`
/// adding trust roots for an internal CA. See
/// `plugins/httpjson/src/http.rs` - the transport is a plugin's business,
/// while this check is pure string work and therefore the core's.
///
/// The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every port,
/// rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate. Twelve
/// parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether
/// `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a check
/// that answers differently in different ports is not a check. (Rust has no
/// URL parser in std in any case, and a crate for one is exactly what this
/// library does not take.)
///
/// The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is never
/// more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
/// the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also breaks on
/// `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
/// refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
/// host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
/// rather than guessed at.
