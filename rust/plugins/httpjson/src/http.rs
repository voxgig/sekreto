//! Just enough HTTP to ask a vault for a secret.
//!
//! The Rust standard library has no HTTP client, so this speaks HTTP/1.1
//! over a TcpStream directly: a GET or POST with headers and an optional
//! body, a status line, and a response body delimited by Content-Length,
//! by chunks, or by the connection closing.
//!
//! https goes over rustls - the one dependency this repo takes, and a
//! deliberate one. A secrets library reaching a remote vault needs TLS, and
//! hand-rolling TLS would be far worse than taking a well-audited crate.
//! Server certificates are verified against the Mozilla root set, plus any
//! extra roots named by `SEKRETO_CA_BUNDLE` - an internal Vault behind a
//! private CA is the common case, not the exotic one.
//!
//! It is still not a general-purpose client: no redirect following, no
//! keep-alive, no client certificates.
