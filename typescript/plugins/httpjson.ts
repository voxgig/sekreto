 * megabyte would do. Eight is chosen so that no honest store can meet it
 * and the check never has to be reasoned about again.
 *
 * A bound is needed because the timeout is not one. Ten seconds on a
 * loopback or datacentre link is gigabytes, and the body is accumulated
 * in memory before it is parsed — measured at 3.2 GB in one port before
 * this. Worse where a client advertises gzip and decompresses
 * transparently, since a few hundred kilobytes of zeros expands to
 * gigabytes in the client's heap. This is a secrets chain running on an
