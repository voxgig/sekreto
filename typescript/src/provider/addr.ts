/** Refuse to send a secret-bearing credential in the clear.
 *
 * A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
 * convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local
 * machine puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for
 * anyone on the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed:
 * that is `vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own
 * test harness.
 *
 * The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every
 * port, rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate.
 * Twelve parsers disagree about malformed input — where userinfo ends,
 * whether `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means — and
 * a check that answers differently in different ports is not a check.
 *
 * The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is
 * never more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address.
 * It ends the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also
 * breaks on `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this
 * does. It refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It
 * compares the host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on
 * is refused rather than guessed at. Each of those can refuse an address
 * that would in fact have been safe; none can allow one that is not. */
