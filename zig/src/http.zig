//! One JSON round-trip, for the providers that talk to a vault over HTTP.
//!
//! std ships both an HTTP client and TLS (std.crypto.tls), so this port
//! needs neither a third-party crate nor a hand-rolled protocol: the whole
//! file is a thin, opinionated wrapper that turns std.http.Client into the
//! `{status, body}` pair every port's `fetchjson` returns.
//!
//! Opinionated in three ways, all of them the canonical's:
//!
//!   - A redirect is never followed. A vault API does not legitimately
//!     redirect, and a followed one would carry X-Vault-Token to the
//!     redirect's host (and could downgrade https to http), which
//!     `checkaddr` - it only ever sees the CONFIGURED address - cannot see.
//!   - A network failure is an ERROR, never a miss: an unreachable store is
//!     a store that could not answer.
//!   - A 200 whose body is not JSON is an error too. The status promised
//!     JSON; treating an incoherent answer as a miss would fall through to
//!     a weaker store. Error statuses may carry any body, so they are
//!     decided on status alone.
