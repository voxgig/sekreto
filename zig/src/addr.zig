/// more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
/// the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also breaks on
/// `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
/// refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
