;; The names, the errors and the text helpers - the half of sekreto that
;; does not know what a provider is.
;;
;; `voxgig.sekreto.providers` builds the four built-in kinds out of these,
;; and `voxgig.sekreto.chain` builds a chain out of those; `voxgig.sekreto`
;; is the one namespace a consumer requires, and republishes all three.
;;
;; The split is not a matter of taste. The provider kinds need the name
;; helpers, so the namespace that defines those cannot be the one that
;; builds a chain out of kinds - a namespace cycle is a load error in
;; Clojure, not a warning.
;;
;; A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.
