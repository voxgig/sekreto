;; Minimal JSON support for sekreto.
;;
;; sekreto adds no third-party dependencies, so it carries just enough JSON
;; to read a vault's answer and write the CLI's own line of output. It is
;; deliberately not a general-purpose library, and it is not
;; clojure.data.json.
;;
;; Values are plain Clojure data - maps with string keys, vectors, strings,
;; doubles, booleans and nil - with ONE addition. Clojure has nil for JSON
;; null, so "there is no value here" needs a marker of its own: NONE. A
;; store answering `null`, and a store answering text that is not JSON at
;; all, mean different things, and only the second is a store that could not
;; answer coherently. `parse` returns NONE for the second and nil for the
;; first, which is the distinction the callers of fetchjson need.
;;
;; A port of typescript/src/Json.ts, which is canonical.
