(defn checkaddr
  "Refuse to send a secret-bearing credential in the clear.

  A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
  convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local machine
  puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for anyone on
  the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed: that is
  `vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own test harness.

  The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every port,
  rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate. A dozen
  parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether
  `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a check
  that answers differently in different ports is not a check.

  The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is never
  more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
  the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also breaks on
  `\\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
  refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
  host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
  rather than guessed at."
