;; The chain: a Sekreto is an ordered list of providers on a voxgig/plugin
;; host. `get` asks each in turn and returns the first hit, so an app can be
;; configured from environment variables in development and a vault in
;; production without changing a line of its own code.
;;
;; THIS NAMESPACE REQUIRES NO PLUGIN, IN ANY FORM. The four built-in kinds
;; - env, memory, dotenv, file - read at most a local file; every other kind
;; is a voxgig/plugin definition under `plugins/`, and a chain may name one
;; only if the calling project handed it in through `:plugins`. That is what
;; keeps an SDK whose chain is `[dotenv env]` from carrying AWS request
;; signing and seven HTTP vault clients. See
;; docs/design/plugin-providers.md.
;;
;; What is plugin's and what is sekreto's:
;;
;;   plugin owns  the catalog, the instances, name+tag addressing, the
;;                lifecycle, and the options each instance was declared
;;                with.
;;   sekreto owns the walk - reading each instance's exported provider off
;;                the host and asking them in order.
;;
;; A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.
