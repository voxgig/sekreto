;; What a provider is, how a provider kind becomes a voxgig/plugin
;; definition - and the four BUILT-IN kinds.
;;
;; A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
;; the value, or nil to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
;; provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
;; `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
;; .env file, HashiCorp Vault or a boru vault.
;;
;; Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that does
;; not hold the secret is a MISS (nil) - the chain carries on. A store that
;; could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host, missing
;; configuration - is an ERROR, because falling through there would quietly
;; reach for a weaker store.
;;
;; THIS NAMESPACE IMPORTS NO HTTP CLIENT, NO HASH FUNCTION AND NO
;; ProcessBuilder. What makes a kind built in is that it needs nothing of
;; the platform beyond reading a local file; every kind that opens a
;; socket, signs a request or spawns a process is a plugin under
;; `plugins/`, its own namespace, required only by a program that names it
;; (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
;;
;; A port of typescript/src/provider/support.ts and
;; typescript/src/provider/builtin.ts, which are canonical.

  Absence is a MISS and the chain carries on; anything else - permission
  denied, an unreadable mount, a failing disk - is an ERROR, because
  returning a miss there falls silently through to a weaker store.

  Asked of the directory, not of the file. The obvious spelling, \"the file
  does not exist\", is wrong in exactly the case the rule exists for: that
  question is \"did the access check throw\", so it answers *no* for a
  permission failure and turned a locked directory - the canonical
  \"unreadable mount\" - into a miss. A path whose parent is a plain file
  really is \"no secrets here\", and that is what this asks. The reason
  string is not consulted: it comes from the C library's strerror and
  follows the machine's locale."

  Nothing runs at `activate`: a provider opens nothing until its first
  lookup, so there is nothing to capture - a provider that does hold a
  resource acquires it there and lets the instance scope unwind it.
