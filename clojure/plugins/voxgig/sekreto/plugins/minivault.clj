;; The mini vault, as a voxgig/plugin definition.
;;
;; A plugin rather than a built-in kind because it needs crypto, and a
;; built-in kind reads at most a local file
;; (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
;;
;; THE KEY DECIDES WHAT THE VAULT HOLDS. A master key reads and writes
;; every name and mints restricted keys. A restricted key reads the names
;; it was granted and CANNOT DERIVE ANY OTHER - the restriction is the
;; cryptography rather than a check this code performs. What that does and
;; does not protect is set out in DOCS.md under "What the mini vault
;; protects".
;;
;; `javax.crypto` carries all four primitives, so nothing here is
;; hand-rolled (AGENTS.md rule 3).
;;
;; A port of typescript/plugins/minivault.ts, which is canonical.
