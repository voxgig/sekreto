;; The HTTP-JSON edge every plugin that speaks to a store shares - and
;; NOTHING IN THE CORE REACHES IT.
;;
;; A chain of the four built-in kinds never loads this namespace, so it
;; never loads `java.net.http` either. That is the whole point of the
;; core/plugin split: an app whose chain is `[dotenv env]` carries no
;; HTTP client at all (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
;;
;; `uriescape` lives here rather than with sigv4 because four plugins
;; that sign nothing need it to build a query string, and reaching it
;; through sigv4 would make them load a hash function to escape a
;; parameter.

;; A port of typescript/plugins/httpjson.ts, which is canonical.
