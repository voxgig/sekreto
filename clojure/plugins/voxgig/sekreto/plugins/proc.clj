  "Run a child to completion and collect both its streams.

  The two streams are drained CONCURRENTLY. Reading stdout to EOF and only
  then reading stderr deadlocks the moment the child writes more than one
  pipe buffer (64 KiB on Linux) to stderr: the parent is blocked waiting for
  stdout, the child is blocked waiting for room on stderr, and neither can
  move. Nothing in this library sets a timeout, so that hang is permanent -
  `get` simply never returns. secretspec's diagnostics are box-drawn and
  reach that size easily.

  The child's stdin is closed rather than left open on a pipe nobody writes
  to, so a CLI that reads it - one prompting for a passphrase when its
  environment variable is absent - sees EOF and gives up instead of waiting
  forever."
