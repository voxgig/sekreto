# sekreto: one interface for secrets, wherever they live.
#
# A Sekreto is an ordered chain of providers. `get` asks each in turn and
# returns the first hit, so an app can be configured from environment
# variables in development and a vault in production without changing a
# line of its own code.
#
# A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.
#
# THE CORE IMPORTS NO PROVIDER THAT OPENS A SOCKET, SPAWNS A PROCESS OR
# SIGNS A REQUEST. The four built-in kinds - env, memory, dotenv, file -
# read at most a local file; every other kind is a voxgig/plugin
# definition under plugins/, and a chain may name one only if the calling
# project handed it in through `plugins`. See
# docs/design/plugin-providers.md.
