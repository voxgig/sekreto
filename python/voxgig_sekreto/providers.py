# What a provider is, how a provider kind becomes a voxgig/plugin
# definition - and the four BUILT-IN kinds.
#
# A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
# the value, or None to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
# provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
# `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
# .env file, HashiCorp Vault or a boru vault.
#
# Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that
# does not hold the secret is a MISS (None) - the chain carries on. A
# store that could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host,
# missing configuration - is an ERROR: falling through there would
# quietly reach for a weaker store.
#
# THIS MODULE IMPORTS NO urllib, NO hashlib AND NO subprocess. What makes
# a kind built in is that it needs nothing of the platform beyond reading
# a local file; every kind that opens a socket, signs a request or spawns
# a process is a plugin under plugins/, its own module, imported only by
# a program that names it (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
#
# A port of typescript/src/provider/support.ts and
# typescript/src/provider/builtin.ts, which are canonical.
