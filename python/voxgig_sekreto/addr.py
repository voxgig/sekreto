# The plaintext-address guard, in the core because it is pure - a handful
# of string steps, no socket - and because it is on the spec: every port
# answers the same for every address in spec/def/store.aon. The plugins
# that dial an address call `checkaddr` before they do.

# A port of typescript/src/provider/addr.ts.

    cleaned up afterwards either: that password was never resolved as a
    secret, so `redact` has never seen it and never will. The host is what a

    """Refuse to send a Vault token in the clear.

    Vault's API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
    convenience. Sending `X-Vault-Token` over http to anything but the local
    machine puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for
    anyone on the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed:
    that is `vault server -dev` and this repo's own test harness.

    The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every port,
    rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate. Twelve
    parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether
    `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a check
    that answers differently in different ports is not a check.

    The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is never
    more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
    the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also breaks on
    `\\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
    refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
    host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
    rather than guessed at.
