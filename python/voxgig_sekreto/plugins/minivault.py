"""The mini vault: every secret a project owns, encrypted, in one file.

A store this library owns outright rather than a client for a server
somebody else runs. It has a master key and restricted keys, and it is the
port's worked example of a definition publishing an API beside its
provider: a chain READS, and writing is a deliberate act with an interface
of its own.

    from voxgig_sekreto import Sekreto
    from voxgig_sekreto.plugins.minivault import createvault, minivault, vaultof

    vault = createvault({'file': 'app.skmv', 'passphrase': MASTER})
    vault.set('api.token', 'tok01')
    vault.grant({'key': 'ci', 'passphrase': CI, 'names': ['api.token']})

    secrets = Sekreto({
        'plugins': [minivault],
        'providers': [{'kind': 'minivault', 'file': 'app.skmv',
                       'vaultkey': 'ci', 'passphrase': CI}],
    })

    secrets.get('api.token')            # the chain reads
    vaultof(secrets).list()             # the API writes

THE FILE FORMAT IS THE CONTRACT, and the vaults committed under
test/fixture/ pin it: a vault written by any port is read by every other.

    magic       4   'SKMV'
    version     1   FORMAT
    kdf         1   1 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
    cipher      1   1 = AES-256-GCM
    reserved    1   0
    keycount    4   uint32
    per key:
      id        1 + bytes            the key id, PLAINTEXT
      salt      1 + bytes
      iters     4                    PBKDF2 rounds for this key
      ring      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the passphrase
      meta      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's meta key
    entrycount  4   uint32
    per entry:
      id        1 + bytes            the blinded lookup id
      name      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's name key
      value     1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under that secret's own key

Integers are big-endian and every length precedes its bytes, so the file
is written with the same two primitives it is read with.

NOTHING OUTSIDE A KEY RECORD IS PLAINTEXT. Secret names are sealed, and an
entry is addressed by a blinded id derived from its own key, so a
restricted key finds what it was granted without the file ever naming the
rest. What the file does show anyone is the key ids and how many secrets
there are.

A port of typescript/plugins/minivault.ts, which is canonical.
