    """SecretSpec (https://secretspec.dev).

    SecretSpec is a declaration - a `secretspec.toml` naming the secrets a
    project needs - plus a chain of its own backends to satisfy them from.
    That makes it the same shape as sekreto one level down, and the reason
    to support it is the same reason sekreto exists: a project that has
    already declared its secrets there should not have to declare them
    again here.

    Read through its CLI, as boru is, because that is the interface it
    offers a program in another language: `secretspec get API_TOKEN`
    prints the value on stdout and nothing else. A sekreto name maps to a
    SecretSpec key exactly as it maps to an environment variable -
    `api.token` is `API_TOKEN` - which is the convention SecretSpec's own
    examples use.

    `backend` selects one of SecretSpec's backends (`--provider`, e.g.
    `keyring` or `dotenv://.env`) and is called `backend` here only
    because `provider` already means something else in this library.

    A reason is required, not optional: SecretSpec records every read in
    an audit log and refuses to read at all without one. sekreto sends
    `sekreto` unless told otherwise, so the audit trail says which tool
    asked.

    store does not hold it, so the chain carries on.

    `Provider backend 'keyring' not found`, which is a store that could
    not answer at all - and reading that as a miss is the worst failure
    this library has, because the chain then falls through to a weaker
