// THE BUILT-IN PROVIDER KINDS - the same four in every port.
//
// A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
// the value, or null to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
// provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
// `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
// .env file or a mounted secret directory.
//
// What makes a kind built in is that it reads AT MOST A LOCAL FILE: no
// socket, no TLS, no crypto, no child process. These four are the floor
// every chain stands on, and a chain that reads secrets from options, the
// environment, a plaintext `.env` and a mounted secret directory works
// with no plugin loaded at all. Everything else - the vault clients, the
// cloud stores, the two CLIs, and `sigv4` with them - is a voxgig/plugin
// definition under `plugins/`, and this file is the reason the core links
// none of it (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
//
// Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that does
// not hold the secret is a MISS (null) - the chain carries on. A store that
// could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host, missing
// configuration - is an ERROR: falling through there would quietly reach
// for a weaker store.
//
// A port of typescript/src/provider/, which is canonical.
