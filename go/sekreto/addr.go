// precisely because the address carries a credential - so printing it
// verbatim wrote the password to stderr and into the logs. It cannot be
// cleaned up afterwards either: that password was never resolved as a
// secret, so Redact has never seen it and never will. The host is what a
// reader needs to identify which chain entry is at fault; the userinfo is
// not.

// CheckAddr refuses to send a Vault token in the clear.
//
// Vault's API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
// convenience. Sending X-Vault-Token over http to anything but the local
// machine puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for
// anyone on the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed:
// that is `vault server -dev` and this repo's own test harness.
//
// The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every port,
// rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate. Twelve
// parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether
// 0177.0.0.1 is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a check that
// answers differently in different ports is not a check.
//
// The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is never
// more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
// the authority at '/', '?' or '#' only, so a client that also breaks on
// '\' (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
// refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
// host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
// rather than guessed at.
