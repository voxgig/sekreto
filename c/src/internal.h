/* What the CORE's own files share, and a consumer never sees: the string
 * helpers and the one local-file read the four built-in kinds need.
 *
 * THE PLUGINS SEE IT TOO, and that direction is the whole point. A plugin
 * compiles against this header and links against the core archive; the
 * core names nothing under `plugins/`, so a build of the core cannot pull
 * one in. Everything a plugin needs that the core must not link - the
 * HTTP transport, TLS, the SHA-256 primitives, a child process - is in
 * `plugins/support.h` instead.
 *
 * Nothing declared here opens a socket, spawns a child or hashes
 * anything. `make check-core` reads the core archive's own list of
 * undefined symbols and says so.

 * file-scope slot, and each `define` exports the INDEX of the provider it
 * built; sek_new reads the index back and looks the pointer up here. It
 * is the shape the zig port arrived at, and the shape plugin's own C port
 * uses for its pending error.
 *
 * This is why sek_new is not reentrant, and it says so. */
