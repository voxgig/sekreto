/* The TLS binding, and the only file in this port that names OpenSSL.
 *
 * The rule this file exists under is AGENTS.md's, stated as a principle
 * rather than a list: cryptographic transport is not hand-rolled. Where a
 * port's standard library has TLS it uses it; where it does not - and C's
 * does not - it binds the platform's audited TLS library, which in C is
 * the one the whole C ecosystem binds. Everything ELSE a standard library
 * lacks is still written in-tree, so json.c, http.c, crypto.c and the PEM
 * reader in crypto.c stay hand-rolled even though libcrypto could do all
 * four. Rust is the worked precedent: `ring` sits inside rustls's closure
 * and rust/src/crypto.rs carries SHA-256 and HMAC anyway.
 *
 * THE AUDIT SURFACE IS `-lssl -lcrypto`, and it is the distribution's
 * OpenSSL: this port pins no version, vendors no source and carries no
 * patch. There is no other edge - `ldd build/sekreto-cli` names libssl,
 * libcrypto and libc, and nothing else.
 *
 * A binding that connects but does not VERIFY is worse than no TLS,
 * because it looks like it works. The four obligations every binding in
 * this repository must meet are met in sek_tls_open below, each marked
 * where it happens:
 *
 *   (1) the chain is verified against the system trust store;
 *   (2) the HOSTNAME is verified - a separate step from (1), and the half
 *       people forget - with the IP-literal case handled separately,
 *       because SSL_set1_host does DNS-name matching and will not match
 *       an iPAddress SAN;
 *   (3) SNI is sent, and NOT for an IP literal, which RFC 6066 forbids;
 *   (4) SEKRETO_CA_BUNDLE adds extra roots, additively.
