/* A mini vault: every secret a project owns, encrypted, in ONE FILE.
 *
 * The store to reach for before there is a vault server. There is
 * nothing to run and nothing to reach over a socket - the whole store is
 * a single binary file - and the same chain that reads it in development
 * reads HashiCorp or AWS in production by changing config, which is the
 * reason sekreto exists.
 *
 * It is a plugin rather than a built-in kind because it needs crypto,
 * which is the line the four built-ins stay behind.
 *
 * THE SECOND OBJECT IN THIS LIBRARY THAT NAMES OpenSSL, and the only
 * other one. `tls.c` is the first. AGENTS.md used to confine the
 * dependency exception to cryptographic TRANSPORT, which is why
 * `sha256.c` writes SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA256 out by hand beside a linked
 * libcrypto that has both; the rule now covers cryptography, because a
 * block cipher protecting secrets AT REST has properties no known-answer
 * vector can check - a table-driven AES passes every vector in the world
 * and still hands its key to anyone who can time a cache. `make
 * check-tls` reads the archives and fails if any THIRD object reaches
 * for it.
 *
 * THE KEY DECIDES WHAT THE VAULT HOLDS. A master key reads and writes
 * every name and mints restricted keys. A restricted key reads the names
 * it was granted and CANNOT DERIVE ANY OTHER - the restriction is the
 * cryptography rather than a check this code performs, so a copy of the
 * file plus a restricted passphrase yields exactly what was granted and
 * nothing else. What that does and does not protect is set out in
 * DOCS.md under "What the mini vault protects".
 *
 * THE FILE FORMAT, which is the contract between the ports:
 *
 *   magic       4   'SKMV'
 *   version     1   FORMAT
 *   kdf         1   1 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
 *   cipher      1   1 = AES-256-GCM
 *   reserved    1   0
 *   keycount    4   uint32
 *   per key:
 *     id        1 + bytes      the key id, PLAINTEXT
 *     salt      1 + bytes
 *     iters     4              PBKDF2 rounds for this key
 *     ring      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the passphrase
 *     meta      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's meta key
 *   entrycount  4   uint32
 *   per entry:
 *     id        1 + bytes      the blinded lookup id
 *     name      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's name key
 *     value     1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under that secret's own key
 *
 * Integers are big-endian and every length precedes its bytes, so the
 * file is written with the same two primitives it is read with.
 *
 * NOTHING OUTSIDE A KEY RECORD IS PLAINTEXT. Secret names are sealed,
 * and an entry is addressed by a blinded id derived from its own key, so
 * a restricted key finds what it was granted without the file ever
 * naming the rest. What the file does show anyone is the key ids and how
 * many secrets there are.
 *
 * A port of typescript/plugins/minivault.ts, which is canonical. The
 * bytes are pinned by the vaults in ../../test/fixture rather than left
 * to agreement between implementations.

/* The vault behind a store in a chain, as its programmatic API.
 *
 * `sek_host` is the voxgig/plugin host the chain is made of, and a
 * definition's exports are readable off it by ref. This is the one call
 * that turns a store into an API, and it lives here rather than in the
 * core because the core knows no plugin.
 *
 * With no store named, the unqualified alias answers: one vault in the
 * chain resolves whatever it is called, and two raise rather than
 * picking one.
 *
 * THE INDEX IS RANGE-CHECKED AS A DOUBLE, BEFORE THE CAST, for the reason
 * `sek_build_at` states: an export is a plugin number, so a hand-written
 * definition may put any double under this key, and converting one that
 * does not fit a size_t is undefined. `!(index < len)` rather than
 * `index >= len` so that a NaN, which compares false with everything, is
 * refused too. */
