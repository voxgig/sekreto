/* The eleven provider kinds that are NOT built in, each a voxgig/plugin
 * definition, plus the transport and the SigV4 signing that come with
 * them.
 *
 * What makes a kind a plugin is that it needs more of the platform than a
 * local file: a socket, a signature or a child process. A chain of the
 * four built-in kinds links none of this, which is the whole point of the
 * split (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
 *
 * LINKING IS THE BOUNDARY, AND A HEADER IS NOT LINKING. Declaring all
 * eleven
 * here costs a consumer nothing: what a binary carries is the objects its
 * link line names. A lean consumer links `plugins/hashicorp.o` and the
 * transport it needs, hands `sek_plugin_hashicorp()` to sek_options, and
 * never has AWS request signing, seven other vault clients or the child
 * process launcher in its binary. `sek_allplugins` is the opposite trade
 * and the honest one: it names all eleven, so an object referencing it pulls
 * every plugin in the library.
 *
 *     Definition *chain[] = {sek_plugin_hashicorp()};
 *     sek_options opts = {0};
 *     opts.plugins = chain;
