/* What the PLUGINS share and the core must never link: the HTTP
 * transport, the TLS seam, the SHA-256 primitives SigV4 is built from,
 * the two encoders, a child process and a clock.
 *
 * ONE TRANSLATION UNIT PER CAPABILITY, and that is a link-time decision
 * rather than a filing preference. A static archive is pulled in an
 * object at a time, so a plugin that signs nothing must not sit in the
 * same object as the signer, and the shared percent-encoder must not
 * either - `sek_uriescape` is used by four stores that hash nothing, so
 * it lives with the transport in `encode.c` and SigV4 depends on it,
 * never the other way round. `make check-core` reads the link and says
 * which objects each plugin actually pulls.
 *
 * The core's own header, `src/internal.h`, is the other half of what a
 * plugin compiles against; nothing here is visible from `src/`.

 * TRANSPORT and nothing else. Rust is the worked precedent - `ring` is
 * already inside rustls's dependency closure and rust/src/crypto.rs still
 * carries both primitives. Both are proved by the SigV4 known-answer
 * vectors: a signature is a chain of these, so one wrong bit fails there.
