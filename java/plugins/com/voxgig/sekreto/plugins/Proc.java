  /**
   * Run a child to completion and collect both its streams.
   *
   * <p>The two streams are drained CONCURRENTLY. Reading stdout to EOF and
   * only then reading stderr deadlocks the moment the child writes more than
   * one pipe buffer (64 KiB on Linux) to stderr: the parent is blocked
   * waiting for stdout, the child is blocked waiting for room on stderr, and
   * neither can move. Nothing in this library sets a timeout, so that hang is
   * permanent - `get()` simply never returns. secretspec's diagnostics are
   * box-drawn and reach that size easily.
   *
   * <p>The child's stdin is closed rather than left open on a pipe nobody
   * writes to, so a CLI that reads it - one prompting for a passphrase when
   * its environment variable is absent - sees EOF and gives up instead of
   * waiting forever.
