   * <p>A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
   * convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local machine
   * puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for anyone on
   * the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed: that is
   * `vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own test
   * harness.
   *
   * <p>The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every
   * port, rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate.
   * Twelve parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends,
   * whether `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a
   * check that answers differently in different ports is not a check.
   *
   * <p>The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is
   * never more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It
   * ends the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also breaks
   * on `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
   * refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
   * host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
   * rather than guessed at.
