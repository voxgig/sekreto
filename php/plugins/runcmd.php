/**
 * Run a child to completion and collect both its streams.
 *
 * Given an ARGV ARRAY, not a command string. `proc_open` with a string runs
 * `/bin/sh -c`, which put every value - the command, the alias, the key -
 * one escaping function away from being interpreted. `escapeshellarg` was
 * doing that job correctly, but it made this the only port whose safety
 * rested on quoting rather than on `execve`, and it broke two things
 * besides: the "cannot run" branch was unreachable, because `sh` always
 * starts and absorbs the exec failure into its own message, and the
 * `BORU_HOME=...` prefix is POSIX-sh syntax that does nothing on Windows,
 * where `proc_open` goes through `cmd.exe`. The array form (PHP 7.4+) makes
 * this port behave like the other eleven.
 *
 * Both pipes are drained TOGETHER. `stream_get_contents` on stdout to EOF
 * and only then on stderr deadlocks the moment the child writes more than
 * one pipe buffer (64 KiB on Linux) to stderr: this process is blocked
 * waiting for stdout, the child is blocked waiting for room on stderr, and
 * neither can move. Nothing in this library sets a timeout, so that hang is
 * permanent. secretspec's diagnostics are box-drawn and reach that size
 * easily.
 *
 * The child's stdin is closed rather than inherited, so a CLI that reads it
 * - one prompting for a passphrase when its environment variable is absent -
 * sees EOF and gives up instead of waiting forever.
 *
 * @param list<string>          $argv
 * @param array<string, string> $env  extra variables for the child only
 *
 * @return array{0: string, 1: string, 2: int} stdout, trimmed stderr, status
