/**
 * SecretSpec (https://secretspec.dev).
 *
 * SecretSpec is a declaration - a `secretspec.toml` naming the secrets a
 * project needs - plus a chain of its own backends to satisfy them from.
 * That makes it the same shape as sekreto one level down, and the reason
 * to support it is the same reason sekreto exists: a project that has
 * already declared its secrets there should not have to declare them
 * again here.
 *
 * Read through its CLI, as boru is, because that is the interface it
 * offers a program in another language: `secretspec get API_TOKEN` prints
 * the value on stdout and nothing else. A sekreto name maps to a
 * SecretSpec key exactly as it maps to an environment variable -
 * `api.token` is `API_TOKEN` - which is the convention SecretSpec's own
 * examples use.
 *
 * `backend` selects one of SecretSpec's backends (`--provider`, e.g.
 * `keyring` or `dotenv://.env`) and is called `backend` here only because
 * `provider` already means something else in this library.
 *
 * A reason is required, not optional: SecretSpec records every read in an
 * audit log and refuses to read at all without one. sekreto sends
 * `sekreto` unless told otherwise, so the audit trail says which tool
 * asked.
