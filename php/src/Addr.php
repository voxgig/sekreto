/**
 * Refuse to send a Vault token in the clear.
 *
 * Vault's API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
 * convenience. Sending `X-Vault-Token` over http to anything but the local
 * machine puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for
 * anyone on the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed:
 * that is `vault server -dev` and this repo's own test harness.
 *
 * The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every port,
 * rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate. Twelve
 * parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether
 * `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a check
 * that answers differently in different ports is not a check.
 *
 * The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is never
 * more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
 * the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also breaks on
 * `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
 * refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
 * host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
 * rather than guessed at.
