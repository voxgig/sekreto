THE SHARED PLUGIN SUPPORT: one HTTP round-trip, and the handful of
helpers that every store which dials one needs.

This module and ffi/sekreto_curl.c are the whole of this port's contact
with the network, and they are UNDER `plugins/`: a chain of the four
built-in kinds links neither, which is the point of the split. Everything
above them - JSON, the ten plugin kinds, SigV4 - is in-tree Lean, and
everything below them is libcurl.

What the binding guarantees, and why, is written out in
ffi/sekreto_curl.c: chain verification against the system store,
HOSTNAME verification (the separate half), SNI, and SEKRETO_CA_BUNDLE as
an ADDITIVE source of extra roots. What this file adds is the contract
the rest of the library depends on: a 10 s bound, an 8 MiB cap, no
redirects, no proxies, HTTP/1.1 - and the rule that a store that could
not answer RAISES rather than missing.

Base64 decoding, percent-escaping and token renewal are here for the same
reason they are in the rust port's `httpjson` crate: several plugins need
them, no plugin should reach into another, and the core needs none of
them.

A port of typescript/plugins/httpjson.ts, which is canonical.

/-- RFC 3986 escaping, which is stricter than the usual URL encoder: AWS
wants everything but the unreserved set escaped, byte by byte over UTF-8,
with UPPERCASE hex. `!'()*` are escaped too - that is the gap against
JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent`. Every store that puts a project name
or a scope into a query string uses it too, so it lives here rather than
in the aws plugin that needs it strictest. -/

/-- The libcurl round-trip. See the framing note in ffi/sekreto_curl.c:
one tag byte, four status bytes, then the payload.

`@&` on every string: the arguments are BORROWED, so the C side reads
them and does not release them. Without it Lean would hand ownership
over and the binding would have to drop each one by hand. -/

/-- A header value with CR and LF removed.

A vault token arrives from configuration and goes out in a header. One
containing a newline would end the header and start another, which is
request splitting; the two characters have no legitimate place in any
value this library sends. -/

/-- One JSON round-trip.

Network failure is ALWAYS an error - an unreachable store is a store
that could not answer, and returning a miss there would fall through to
a weaker store on an attacker's cue. So is an oversized body, and so is
a 200 whose body does not parse. A non-200 with an unreadable body is
fine: error statuses are decided on status alone. -/

Whitespace is stripped first - the callers accept payloads wrapped across
lines - and then anything outside the alphabet, a run of more than two
`=`, or a length that is not a multiple of four is REFUSED. A lenient
decoder silently skips the bytes it does not recognise and hands back
plausible-looking bytes for a corrupted payload, which then get returned
as the secret; refusing is the only safe answer, and every caller turns a
refusal into an error rather than a miss. -/
