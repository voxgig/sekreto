/-
The secrets facade: a chain of providers plus a cache.

A Sekreto is an ordered chain of providers. `get` asks each in turn and
returns the first hit, so an app can be configured from environment
variables in development and a vault in production without changing a
line of its own code.

EVERY CONFIGURED PROVIDER IS A voxgig/plugin INSTANCE, addressed by
name+tag: `kind` for a store named after its kind and `kind$store`
otherwise, so `Sekreto.instances` reads like the chain. plugin owns the
catalog, the instances and the lifecycle; sekreto owns the walk, because
`lookup` is inherently asynchronous and voxgig/plugin has no async
surface to compose it with.

A chain may name only the four built-in kinds and whatever definitions
the calling project passed in `Options.plugins`. That is what keeps an
app whose chain is `[dotenv, env]` from linking AWS request signing and
seven HTTP vault clients.

A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.

namespace Sekreto

/-- The store name a live provider answers to when nothing says
otherwise.

`describe` opens with the provider's kind - `hashicorp:...`,
`dotenv:...`, plain `env` - so the kind is the natural default, and a
custom provider gets a sensible name without implementing anything
extra. A spec'd provider's store is its `name` or its `kind`, decided
before the provider exists. -/
def storename (provider : Provider) : String :=
  takeWhile provider.describe (fun ch => ':' != ch)

/-- One provider in the chain, under the store name it answers to, and
the ref of the plugin instance that built it - `""` for a live provider
handed in directly, which no instance backs. -/
structure Entry where
  store : String
  ref : String
  provider : Provider

/-- One resolved value, with the store it came from. -/
structure Cached where
  store : String
  name : String
  value : String

/-- What a chain is made of. `providers` is the chain in resolution
order; `plugins` is the provider kinds beyond the built-ins that it may
name. Static and explicit: the calling project imports the plugins it
needs and passes them here, and a kind it did not pass is unknown to this
Sekreto. -/
structure Options where
  providers : List ProviderSpec := []
  plugins : List Plugin.Definition := []
  cache : Bool := true

/-- The catalog's names, sorted - what the unknown-kind message lists. -/
def catalognames (catalog : List Plugin.Definition) : List String :=
  Plugin.Value.sortWith Plugin.Value.strLe (catalog.map (·.name))

/-- The message for a kind the catalog does not hold.

A kind sekreto has never heard of is a typo; a kind that exists as a
plugin but was not passed in is the split working as designed and telling
you what to pass. Collapsing the two was the first thing that made the
split confusing to use. -/
def unknownkind (kind : String) (catalog : List Plugin.Definition) : String :=
  "sekreto: unknown provider kind: " ++ kind ++
  " (available: " ++ String.intercalate ", " (catalognames catalog) ++ ")" ++
  (if PLUGINKINDS.contains kind then
    " - " ++ kind ++ " is a sekreto plugin, not built in: pass it in the plugins option"
   else "")

/-- Run one plugin operation, and put its failure into this library's
terms.

A `SekretoError` that crossed the boundary comes back out as ITSELF, byte
for byte: `providerplugin` put it under `ERROR_CODE` with the message as
`cause`, and this is the one place that takes it off again. Anything else
is not sekreto's to rewrite and surfaces as the host worded it. -/
def runplugin {α : Type} (act : Plugin.PluginM α) : IO α := do
  match ← act.run with
  | .ok value => return value
  | .error err =>
    let cause := err.details.get "cause"
    if ERROR_CODE == err.code && cause.isStr then fail cause.asStr else fail err.message

end Sekreto

/-- The secrets facade: a chain of providers plus a cache.

Two ways to read. `get` is transparent - it walks the chain and takes the
first hit, and the caller never learns which store answered. `getfrom` is
directed - it names the store, and only that store is asked. Use the
first for ordinary configuration, the second when *which* store holds a
secret is part of what you mean.

There is no `Repr`, `ToString` or `deriving` anywhere on this structure,
and there cannot be one: most of its fields are `IO.Ref`, which has no
printer in Lean at all. So the hazard every other port answers with a
hand-written print hook - `print(sekreto)` emitting every resolved secret
- does not exist here; `Sekreto.inspect` is offered because the ports
agree on the shape, not because anything would otherwise leak. -/
structure Sekreto where
  /-- The voxgig/plugin host every spec'd provider is an instance of.
  Read it for introspection - `Sekreto.instances` names each store's ref
  and status - and nothing on it advances the chain. -/
  host : Plugin.HostState
  /-- The definitions this Sekreto can build: the built-ins, then what
  `Options.plugins` handed in. -/
  catalog : IO.Ref (List Plugin.Definition)
  /-- The chain, in resolution order. A ref, so `close` can empty it. -/
  entries : IO.Ref (List Sekreto.Entry)
  /-- Resolved values, keyed by (store, name). A LIST, not a map: the
  store a value came from stays attached, and redaction order does not
  vary between runs. -/
  cache : IO.Ref (List Sekreto.Cached)
  /-- Every value ever resolved, for `redactText`. Kept independently of
  the read cache, so `cache := false` does not silently disable
  redaction; append-only for the object's life, so neither `refresh` nor
  `close` forgets a secret that has already been handed out. -/

The instance is `kind` for a store named after its kind and `kind$store`
otherwise - `hashicorp$prod` - so `instances` reads like the chain. A
store name that is already taken gets a numbered tag from the host
instead, because two providers MAY share a store name (a directed read
walks both) and an instance ref may not. -/

never cached; and `seen` is appended to whether caching is on or off. A
