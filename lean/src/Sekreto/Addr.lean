Address checking: CORE, never a plugin.

Two pure functions over a string, called by every network kind before it
opens anything. Hand-parsed, and never with a platform URL type: a dozen
parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether
`0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a check
that answers differently in different ports is not a check.

The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is never
MORE PERMISSIVE than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also breaks on
`\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
rather than guessed at.

/-- An address with any userinfo replaced by `[redacted]`, for messages.

Every refusal below names the address it refused, and one of them fires
precisely because the address carries a credential - so printing it
verbatim would write the password to stderr and into the logs. It cannot
be cleaned up afterwards either: that password was never resolved as a
secret, so `redact` has never seen it and never will. -/

    match lastIndexOfChar authority '@' with
    | none => addr
    | some at' => addr.take (mark + 3) ++ "[redacted]" ++ addr.drop (mark + 3 + at')

/-- The four literal spellings of the local machine. Nothing is
normalised: `0177.0.0.1`, `2130706433`, `127.0.0.2` and
`[::ffff:127.0.0.1]` are all refused rather than guessed at. -/

/-- Refuse to send a secret-bearing credential in the clear.

A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local machine
puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for anyone on
the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed: that is
`vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own test
harness. -/
