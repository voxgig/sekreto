The pure core of sekreto: names, keys, `.env` text and redaction.

Everything here is a total function over strings, with no platform
underneath it - nothing reads a file, opens a socket or samples a clock.
The chain that uses them is `Sekreto.Chain`, the providers are
`Sekreto.Builtin` and the plugin modules, and this module is what all
three agree about.

Two shapes of failure, and they are never interchangeable. A store that
does not hold the secret is a MISS (`none`) and the chain carries on. A
store that could not ANSWER throws. Getting that backwards makes a chain
fall silently through to a weaker store, which is the worst failure this
library has.

Lean has no exception type of its own to subclass, and `SekretoError`
carries a message and nothing else in every port, so a refusal here is
`IO.userError message` - whose `toString` IS the message, byte for byte.
The pure functions that can refuse answer `Except String String`
instead, because Lean's are pure and a caller that has no `IO` to run in
still has to be able to ask.

The pure half of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.

/-- Anything sekreto refuses to do: a bad name, a missing secret, a
provider that could not be reached. The message is the whole contract -
no code, no fields, no cause. -/

/-- Is this a well-formed secret name: dot-separated `[a-z0-9_]+`?

Never raises, whatever it is handed. The check is a character scan and
not a regex on purpose: in Python, PCRE, Perl and .NET `$` also matches
before a final newline, so `api.token\n` passed in four ports. The corpus
pins that case, and the two like it, as false. -/

/-- The name, or a refusal. Every entry point checks its name here. -/

The prefix is NOT uppercased - it is written as it is meant. -/

/-- Where a name lives in a KV vault: `api.token` -> `api` / `token`.

A single-segment name has no path of its own, so it becomes a secret of
that name with the conventional field `value`. -/

/-- A name flattened to one segment: `api.token` -> `api_token` (GCP
Secret Manager, `_`) or `api-token` (Azure Key Vault, `-`).

Those stores have no path hierarchy and reject dots in ids, so the dots
become the store's conventional separator. With `-` as the separator,
underscores flatten too: Azure Key Vault's alphabet is letters, digits
and hyphens only, and a valid sekreto name like `with_underscore` must
still be representable there. -/

  let flat := String.intercalate sep (segments (← checkname name))

hierarchy, rooted at `/` (or at a prefix): `db.pass.main` ->

/-- Unescape a double-quoted `.env` value.

A scan, not a chain of replacements: `\n \r \t \\ \"` are the whole
alphabet, ANY OTHER escape is preserved as backslash plus character, and
a trailing backslash is literal. -/

/-- Parse `.env` text into ordered raw keys and values.

There is no `.env` standard, so this function is the specification.
Deliberately small: `KEY=value`, an optional `export`, `#` comments on
their own line, and single- or double-quoted values (double quotes also
unescape). A line with no `=`, or with an empty key, is skipped SILENTLY
- it does not abort the lines after it. Never raises. -/

/-- Replace known secret values in text with `[redacted]`.

Only values of four characters or more are replaced: shorter ones are
too likely to appear in ordinary text, and redacting them would make
logs unreadable without making them safer.

LONGEST FIRST, always, and over a COPY of the caller's list - `values` is
`seen` when this is called through `Sekreto.redactText`, and reordering
it would reorder the live redaction history. The replacement is a literal
substring pass and not a pattern, so a secret full of metacharacters is
not interpreted. -/

  let usable := values.filter (fun value => 4 ≤ value.length)
  let ordered := usable.mergeSort (fun left right => right.length ≤ left.length)
