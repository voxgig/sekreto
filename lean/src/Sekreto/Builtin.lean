THE BUILT-IN PROVIDER KINDS - the same four in every port.

What makes a kind built in is that it needs nothing of the platform
beyond reading a local file: no socket, no TLS, no crypto, no child
process. These four are the floor every chain stands on, and a chain that
reads secrets from options, the environment, a plaintext `.env` and a
mounted secret directory works with no plugin loaded at all. Everything
else - the vault clients, the cloud stores, the two CLIs, and SigV4 with
them - is a voxgig/plugin definition under `plugins/`, and a chain may
name one only if the calling project handed it in.

A port of typescript/src/provider/builtin.ts, which is canonical.

/-- A `.env` file, read once, keyed exactly like the environment.

LAZILY: the `stores` corpus group puts a dotenv provider in a chain and
never looks anything up, so an eager constructor would read whatever
`.env` happened to sit in the working directory. -/

/-- A directory of one-secret-per-file entries, keyed like the
environment: `api.token` reads `<dir>/API_TOKEN`.

This is the shape of a mounted Kubernetes Secret, a Docker or Swarm
secret, and a systemd credentials directory, so those all work with no
further configuration. Read on EVERY lookup, with no caching. One
trailing newline is stripped - tools that write these files disagree
about it, and a newline is never part of a secret on purpose. -/
