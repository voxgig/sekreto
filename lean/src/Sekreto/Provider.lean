What a provider is, what its declarative form looks like, and how a
provider kind becomes a voxgig/plugin definition.

A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
the value, or `none` to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
`api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
.env file, HashiCorp Vault, AWS, GCP, Azure or a boru vault.

Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that
does not hold the secret is a MISS (`none`) - the chain carries on. A
store that could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host, missing
configuration - RAISES: falling through there would reach for a weaker
store without saying so.

THIS MODULE IS THE WHOLE BRIDGE TO voxgig/plugin, and the only file in
the core that imports it. A provider kind is a plugin `Definition`; a
configured provider is an instance of one. What the bridge has to work
around is that plugin's value model carries numbers, strings, lists and
maps - and no pointers - so a `define` cannot hand a Lean closure back
through `inst.export`. See `slotput` below.

A port of typescript/src/provider/support.ts, which is canonical.

/-- A source of secrets: two functions and no lifecycle.

A record of functions rather than a class, so the provider set stays open
- a caller can put its own provider in a chain without this library
knowing the type. `lookup` is in `IO` because the four built-in kinds
already read the environment and the filesystem; `describe` is not,
because it is fixed when the provider is built and the chain calls it at
construction to derive a default store name. -/

  /-- The value, or `none` if this provider does not have it. A store
  that could not ANSWER throws instead: the two are never the same. -/

  provider's kind, because `storename` is everything before the first

There is no `deriving Repr` on this structure and there must not be: a
derived printer would put the service-account JWT and the AppRole secret
id into `IO.eprintln s!"bad chain: {specs}"`, which is exactly what
someone writes when a chain will not build. Fields that hold a
credential report whether they are set, never what they are. -/

/-- The declarative form of a provider, as used in config and in the
shared spec. `kind` names a built-in or a plugin; everything else is that
kind's own.

Every string field defaults to empty rather than being optional: "not
configured" and "configured empty" mean the same thing everywhere in this
library. `kv` is the only number and `values` the only map.

A spec reaches its definition as the plugin instance's OPTIONS:
`optionsof` encodes it with the field names as keys - the spec's own key
names, in every port - and `specof` reads it back. -/

/-- Does this read failure mean "no secrets here", rather than "I could
not answer"?

Absence is a MISS and the chain carries on; anything else - permission
denied, an unreadable mount, a failing disk - is an ERROR, because
returning a miss there falls silently through to a weaker store.

Asked of the DIRECTORY, not of the file. The obvious spelling, "does the
file exist", is wrong in exactly the case the rule exists for: an
existence predicate answers false for a permission error, and would turn
a locked directory - the canonical unreadable mount - into a miss. A path
whose parent is a plain file really is "no secrets here", and that is
what this asks. -/

  match (System.FilePath.mk path).parent with
  | none => return false
  | some dir => return !(← dir.isDir)

/-- The bytes of a file; `none` when there are no secrets there.

`noFileOrDirectory` is ENOENT and is always absence. Anything else is
put to `absentpath`, which answers for ENOTDIR and refuses for everything
else - the refusal carries the underlying failure out to the caller,
which names the provider in the message.

READING A LOCAL FILE IS WHAT THE CORE IS ALLOWED TO DO. It is the line
between a built-in kind and a plugin, so this lives here and not under
`plugins/` - `dotenv` and `file` need it, and so does the one plugin
that reads a pod's service-account token off disk. -/

def PROVIDER_EXPORT : String := "provider"

/-- The voxgig/plugin error code a `SekretoError` travels under when it
is raised inside a definition's `define`.

plugin wraps a code-less error raised by a callback as
`plugin_define_failed`, and keeps an error that already carries a code. A
provider that refuses its own configuration - `kv: 3`, a missing project
- raises a `SekretoError`, and that message is pinned by the spec byte
for byte, so it must come back out of the host exactly as it went in.
`providerplugin` gives it this code on the way in; `Sekreto` turns it
back into a `SekretoError` on the way out. -/
def ERROR_CODE : String := "sekreto_error"

/-- Providers built by a definition's `define`, waiting for the chain to
collect them.

VOXGIG/PLUGIN'S VALUES CARRY NUMBERS AND STRINGS, NOT POINTERS, so a
`define` cannot export the `Provider` it built. It exports the INDEX of
one of these slots instead, and `Sekreto.sekreto` reads the index back
off the host and takes the provider out. The zig port does the same thing
for the same reason.

Module-global, and set for no longer than one construction: `define` puts
a provider in and the chain takes it straight out again, and a chain that
fails part-way drops whatever it left behind. Two threads building chains
at once would race this, and this port - like the plugin port under it -
does not claim to support that. -/

/-- A provider kind, as a voxgig/plugin definition.

The definition's `name` is the `kind` a `ProviderSpec` names; its
`define` reads the spec as the instance's options, builds the provider
with `make`, and exports the slot it parked it in. Nothing runs at
`activate`: a provider opens nothing until its first lookup, so there is
nothing to capture - a provider that does hold a resource acquires it
there and lets the instance scope unwind it.

Every built-in and every plugin is made this way, so a custom provider
kind is one call:

    providerplugin "mystore" (fun spec => mystoreprovider spec.addr)

WHICH FAILURES ARE SEKRETO'S IS DECIDED BY THE CONSTRUCTOR OF THE ERROR,
not by guessing at its text. `SekretoError` is `IO.userError` and nothing
else is, so a `userError` raised by `make` is a provider refusing its own
configuration and comes back out under `ERROR_CODE` byte for byte; every
other `IO.Error` - a missing file, a permission denial - is not sekreto's
to rewrite and surfaces as the host reports it, naming the instance. -/
