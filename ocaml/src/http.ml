(* Just enough HTTP to ask a vault for a secret.

   OCaml's distribution has sockets and no HTTP client, so this speaks
   HTTP/1.1 over a Unix socket directly: a GET or POST with headers and an
   optional body, a status line, and a response body delimited by
   Content-Length, by chunks, or by the connection closing. That is the
   house rule - HTTP framing is written in-tree - and it is why the port
   binds libssl rather than libcurl.

   https rides src/tls.ml, which is the whole of the port's third-party
   surface.

   It is deliberately not a general-purpose client.

   NO REDIRECTS. A vault API does not legitimately redirect, and a followed
   redirect would carry X-Vault-Token to a host `checkaddr` never saw, and
   could downgrade https to http.

   NO PROXIES. Nothing here reads http_proxy, https_proxy or ALL_PROXY. The
   GCP and Azure metadata endpoints are not loopback, and a proxy variable
   in the environment has sent a Vault token in the clear before. *)

let timeout = 10.0

(* How much of a response body will be read before the store is treated as
   having answered incoherently. Ports carry the same bound.

   Far above anything real - the largest legitimate payload this library
   fetches is Doppler's whole-config download, measured in kilobytes. A
   bound is needed because the timeout is not one: it is per read, so a
   server that keeps sending resets it forever, and the body is accumulated
   in memory before it is parsed. This runs on an application's startup
   path, so the failure is the application never starting. *)
