(* sekreto: one interface for secrets, wherever they live.

   A Sekreto is an ordered chain of providers. `get` asks each in turn and
   returns the first hit, so an app can be configured from environment
   variables in development and a vault in production without changing a
   line of its own code.

   A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It answers
   with the value, or None to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
   provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
   `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
   .env file, HashiCorp Vault or a boru vault.

   THE CHAIN IS A voxgig/plugin HOST. Each spec'd provider is an instance
   on it, addressed by name and tag - `hashicorp` for a store named after
   its kind, `hashicorp$prod` otherwise - so `Sekreto.host` reads like the
   chain. Only four kinds are built in: `env`, `memory`, `dotenv` and
   `file`, the ones that read at most a local file. Every kind that opens a
   socket, signs a request or spawns a process lives under `plugins/`, and
   a chain may name one only if the calling project handed it to
   `~plugins`. That is what keeps a chain of built-ins free of TLS, of AWS
   request signing and of seven HTTP vault clients.

   A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical. *)
