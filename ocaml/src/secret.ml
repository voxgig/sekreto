(* What a secret is called, what a provider is, and what sekreto refuses.

   The floor the whole library stands on: the error type, the `provider`
   record, the pure name functions every kind shares, and redaction. It
   reads nothing, opens nothing and depends on nothing - not even on
   voxgig/plugin.

   It is a separate module from `Sekreto` only because OCaml compiles a
   module before anything that uses it, and the facade needs the four
   built-in kinds, which need this. `Sekreto` re-exports every name below,
   so a caller writes `Sekreto.envkey` and never has to know.

   A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical. *)

(* Anything sekreto refuses to do: a bad name, a missing secret, a provider
   that could not be reached. The message is the whole contract - no code,
   no fields, no cause. *)
exception Sekreto_error of string

(* The conformance runner reads a subject's failure with
   `Printexc.to_string`, and so does any OCaml host that catches this.
   Without a printer the message would be reported as
   `Secret.Sekreto_error("...")`, and the corpus pins refusal messages
   byte for byte. *)

let fail message = raise (Sekreto_error message)

(* A source of secrets.

   A record of two functions rather than a class or a module type: the
   provider set is open, a provider carries its own state in its closures,
   and a caller can hand in one of its own with no ceremony. *)

   The obvious `^[a-z0-9_]+$` is not the check it looks like: in several
   regex dialects `$` also matches before a final newline, and four ports
   accepted `api.token\n` because of it. The corpus pins that case, and
   `api\n.token` and `api.token\r` with it. A character scan cannot have
   the bug. *)

   become the store's conventional separator. With `-` as the separator,
