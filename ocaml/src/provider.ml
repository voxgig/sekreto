(* What a provider's declarative form looks like, how a provider kind
   becomes a voxgig/plugin definition - and the four BUILT-IN kinds.

   THIS MODULE OPENS NO SOCKET, SIGNS NOTHING AND SPAWNS NOTHING. What
   makes a kind built in is that it needs nothing of the platform beyond
   reading a local file, so `env`, `memory`, `dotenv` and `file` are here
   and every kind that dials a store is a plugin under `plugins/`, reached
   only by a program that names it.

   Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that
   does not hold the secret is a MISS (None) - the chain carries on. A
   store that could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host, missing
   configuration - is an ERROR: falling through there would quietly reach
   for a weaker store, which is the worst failure this library has.

   A port of typescript/src/provider/support.ts and
   typescript/src/provider/builtin.ts, which are canonical. *)

(* Refuse to send a secret-bearing credential in the clear.

   A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
   convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local machine
   puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for anyone on
   the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed: that is
   `vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own harness.

   The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every port,
   rather than by each platform's URL parser. A dozen parsers disagree about
   malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether `0177.0.0.1` is loopback,
   what an unclosed bracket means - and a check that answers differently in
   different ports is not a check.

   The rule this parse obeys: it is never MORE PERMISSIVE than the client
   that will dial the address. It ends the authority at `/`, `?` or `#`
   only, so a client that also breaks on a backslash can only ever see a
   shorter host than this does. It refuses userinfo outright rather than
   locating its end. It compares the host literally, so a numeric form no
   parser here agrees on is refused rather than guessed at. *)

   provider that refuses its own configuration - `kv: 3`, a missing project
   - raises a Sekreto_error, and the spec pins that message byte for byte,
   so it must come back out of the host exactly as it went in.

   built and `Sekreto` reads it back, which is the shape the zig port takes
   for the same reason (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).

(* A provider kind, as a voxgig/plugin definition.

   This is the whole bridge between the two libraries. The definition's
   name is the `kind` a spec names; its `define` reads the spec back off
   `inst.options`, builds the provider with `make`, and exports the handle.
   Nothing runs at `activate`: a provider opens nothing until its first
   lookup, so there is nothing to capture - a provider that does hold a
   resource acquires it there and lets the instance scope unwind it.

   Every built-in and every plugin is made this way, so a custom provider
   kind is one call:
