(* A mini vault: every secret a project owns, encrypted, in ONE FILE.

   The store to reach for before there is a vault server. There is nothing
   to run and nothing to reach over a socket - the whole store is a single
   binary file - and the same chain that reads it in development reads
   HashiCorp or AWS in production by changing config, which is the reason
   sekreto exists.

   A PLUGIN, not a built-in: this kind needs crypto, which is the line the
   four built-in kinds stay behind. The four primitives come from the
   OpenSSL this port already links, through `plugins/minivault_stubs.c` -
   OCaml's distribution has no cipher at all, and the rule against new
   packages stands. That file's header says why the dependency exception
   now reaches this far.

   THE KEY DECIDES WHAT THE VAULT HOLDS. A master key reads and writes
   every name and mints restricted keys. A restricted key reads the names
   it was granted and CANNOT DERIVE ANY OTHER - the restriction is the
   cryptography rather than a check this code performs, so a copy of the
   file plus a restricted passphrase yields exactly what was granted and
   nothing else. What that does and does not protect is set out in DOCS.md
   under "What the mini vault protects".

   THE FILE FORMAT, which is the contract between the ports:

     magic       4   'SKMV'
     version     1   format
     kdf         1   1 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
     cipher      1   1 = AES-256-GCM
     reserved    1   0
     keycount    4   uint32
     per key:
       id        1 + bytes      the key id, PLAINTEXT
       salt      1 + bytes
       iters     4              PBKDF2 rounds for this key
       ring      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the passphrase
       meta      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's meta key
     entrycount  4   uint32
     per entry:
       id        1 + bytes      the blinded lookup id
       name      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's name key
       value     1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under that secret's own key

   Integers are big-endian and every length precedes its bytes, so the
   file is written with the same two primitives it is read with.

   NOTHING OUTSIDE A KEY RECORD IS PLAINTEXT. Secret names are sealed, and
   an entry is addressed by a blinded id derived from its own key, so a
   restricted key finds what it was granted without the file ever naming
   the rest. What the file does show anyone is the key ids and how many
   secrets there are.

   A port of typescript/plugins/minivault.ts, which is canonical. The
   bytes are pinned by the vaults in test/fixture rather than left to
   agreement between implementations. *)
