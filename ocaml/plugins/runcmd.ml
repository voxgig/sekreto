(* Running a store's own CLI, and collecting both its streams.

   Two of the ten plugin kinds read their store through a child process -
   `boru` and `secretspec` - and a child process is one of the three things
   that keeps a kind out of the core, beside a socket and a signature. *)

type ran = { out : string; why : string; status : int }

(* Where a command lives, or nowhere.

   Resolved before forking: OCaml's `create_process` execs in the child, so
   a command that is not there makes the child exit 127 with no error in the
   parent - which is indistinguishable from a command that ran and failed.
   "cannot run" and "the store said no" are different answers. *)

(* Run a child to completion and collect both its streams.

   The two streams are drained CONCURRENTLY, through one select loop.
   Reading stdout to EOF and only then reading stderr deadlocks the moment
   the child writes more than one pipe buffer (64 KiB on Linux) to stderr:
   the parent is blocked waiting for stdout, the child is blocked waiting
   for room on stderr, and neither can move. Nothing here sets a timeout, so
   that hang is permanent - `get` simply never returns. secretspec's
   diagnostics are box-drawn and reach that size easily.

   The child's stdin is closed rather than left open on a pipe nobody writes
   to, so a CLI that reads it - one prompting for a passphrase when its
   environment variable is absent - sees EOF and gives up instead of waiting
   forever.

   Arguments go as an array, never through a shell, and no secret is ever
   put on a command line where the process table would publish it. *)
