# frozen_string_literal: true

# The plaintext-address guard, in the core because it is pure - a handful
# of string steps, no socket - and because it is on the spec: every port
# answers the same for every address in spec/def/store.aon. The plugins
# that dial an address call `checkaddr` before they do.
#
# A port of typescript/src/provider/addr.ts, which is canonical.

  # An address with any userinfo replaced by `[redacted]`, for messages.
  #
  # Every refusal below names the address it refused, and one of them fires
  # precisely because the address carries a credential - so printing it
  # verbatim wrote the password to stderr and into the logs. It cannot be
  # cleaned up afterwards either: that password was never resolved as a
  # secret, so redact() has never seen it and never will. The host is what a
  # reader needs to identify which chain entry is at fault; the userinfo is
  # not.

  # A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
  # convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local
  # machine puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for
  # anyone on the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed:
  # that is `vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own
  # test harness.
  #
  # The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every
  # port, rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate.
  # Twelve parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends,
  # whether `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and
  # a check that answers differently in different ports is not a check.
  #
  # The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is
  # never more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address.
  # It ends the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also
  # breaks on `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this
  # does. It refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It
  # compares the host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees
  # on is refused rather than guessed at.
