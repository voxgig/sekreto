# What a provider is, how a provider kind becomes a voxgig/plugin
# definition - and the four BUILT-IN kinds.
#
# A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
# the value, or nil to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
# provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
# `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
# .env file, HashiCorp Vault or a boru vault.
#
# Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that
# does not hold the secret is a MISS (nil) - the chain carries on. A
# store that could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host,
# missing configuration - is an ERROR: falling through there would
# quietly reach for a weaker store.
#
# THIS FILE REQUIRES NO net/http, NO openssl AND NO open3. What makes a
# kind built in is that it needs nothing of the platform beyond reading a
# local file; every kind that opens a socket, signs a request or spawns a
# process is a plugin under plugins/, its own file, required only by a
# program that names it (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
#
# A port of typescript/src/provider/support.ts and
# typescript/src/provider/builtin.ts, which are canonical.

  # code. A provider that refuses its own configuration - `kv: 3`, a
  # missing project - raises a SekretoError, and that message is pinned
  # by the spec byte for byte, so it must come back out of the host
  # exactly as it went in. `providerplugin` gives it this code on the way
  # in; `Sekreto` turns it back into a SekretoError on the way out.

  # A provider kind, as a voxgig/plugin definition.
  #
  # This is the whole bridge between the two libraries. The definition's
  # `name` is the `kind` a spec names; its `define` reads the spec as
  # `inst.options`, builds the provider with `make`, and exports it.
  # Nothing runs at `activate`: a provider opens nothing until its first
  # lookup, so there is nothing to capture - a provider that does hold a
  # resource acquires it there and lets the instance scope unwind it.
  #
  # Every built-in and every plugin is made this way, so a custom
  # provider kind is one call:
