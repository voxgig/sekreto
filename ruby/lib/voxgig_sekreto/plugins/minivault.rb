# A port of typescript/plugins/minivault.ts, which is canonical.
#
# A mini vault: every secret a project owns, encrypted, in ONE FILE.
#
# THE KEY DECIDES WHAT THE VAULT HOLDS. A master key reads and writes
# every name and mints restricted keys. A restricted key reads the names
# it was granted and CANNOT DERIVE ANY OTHER - the restriction is the
# cryptography rather than a check this code performs. What that does and
# does not protect is set out in DOCS.md under "What the mini vault
# protects".
#
# OpenSSL is ruby's standard library and carries all four primitives, so
# nothing here is hand-rolled (AGENTS.md rule 3).
