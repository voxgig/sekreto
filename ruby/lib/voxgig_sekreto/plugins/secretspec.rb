  # Does this SecretSpec failure mean "no such secret" rather than "I
  # could not answer"?
  #
  # SecretSpec says `Secret 'API_TOKEN' not found` for both a name it does
  # not declare and one declared with no value, and both are misses: this
  # store does not hold it, so the chain carries on.
  #
  # MATCHED ON THE WHOLE PHRASE, NOT ON "not found". SecretSpec also says
  # `Provider backend 'keyring' not found`, which is a store that could
  # not answer at all - and reading that as a miss is the worst failure
  # this library has, because the chain then falls through to a weaker
  # store without saying so. The key is required to appear, so the two
  # cannot be confused.

  # SecretSpec (https://secretspec.dev).
  #
  # SecretSpec is a declaration - a `secretspec.toml` naming the secrets a
  # project needs - plus a chain of its own backends to satisfy them from.
  # That makes it the same shape as sekreto one level down, and the reason
  # to support it is the same reason sekreto exists: a project that has
  # already declared its secrets there should not have to declare them
  # again here.
  #
  # Read through its CLI, as boru is, because that is the interface it
  # offers a program in another language: `secretspec get API_TOKEN`
  # prints the value on stdout and nothing else. A sekreto name maps to a
  # SecretSpec key exactly as it maps to an environment variable -
  # `api.token` is `API_TOKEN` - which is the convention SecretSpec's own
  # examples use.
  #
  # `backend` selects one of SecretSpec's backends (`--provider`, e.g.
  # `keyring` or `dotenv://.env`) and is called `backend` here only
  # because `provider` already means something else in this library.
  #
  # A reason is required, not optional: SecretSpec records every read in
  # an audit log and refuses to read at all without one. sekreto sends
  # `sekreto` unless told otherwise, so the audit trail says which tool
  # asked.
