# The HTTP half of every plugin that speaks to a store over the wire, in
# one place and OUTSIDE the core: a chain of built-ins never requires this
# file. One JSON round-trip, bounded in time and in size, refusing
# redirects and ignoring proxies; and the small helpers every store client
# needs.
#
# `uriescape` lives here rather than with sigv4 because four plugins that
# never sign anything need it - azure, 1password, doppler, infisical - and
# reaching it through sigv4 would make each of them require openssl. It is
# RFC 3986 escaping, which is stricter than Ruby's own encoders: AWS wants
# `!`, `'`, `(`, `)` and `*` escaped too, and CGI.escape writes a space as
# `+`.
#
# A port of typescript/plugins/httpjson.ts, which is canonical.
