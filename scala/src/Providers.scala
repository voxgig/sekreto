// THE BUILT-IN PROVIDER KINDS - the same four in every port.
//
// A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
// the value, or None to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
// provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
// `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
// .env file or a mounted secret directory.
//
// What makes a kind built in is that it reads AT MOST A LOCAL FILE: no
// socket, no TLS, no crypto, no child process. These four are the floor
// every chain stands on, and a chain that reads secrets from options, the
// environment, a plaintext `.env` and a mounted secret directory works with
// no plugin loaded at all. Everything else - the vault clients, the cloud
// stores, the two CLIs, and `sigv4` with them - is a voxgig/plugin
// definition under `plugins/`, and this file is the reason the core links
// none of it (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
//
// Two failure shapes, and they are never interchangeable. A store that does
// not hold the secret is a MISS (None) - the chain carries on. A store that
// could not answer - bad credentials, unreachable host, missing
// configuration - is an ERROR: falling through there would quietly reach
// for a weaker store.
//
// A port of typescript/src/provider/, which is canonical.

    * held to must not vary with which vault client happens to be loaded,

    * library states once. It reads a string and opens nothing.
    *
    * The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every
    * port, rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate.
    * A dozen parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends,
    * whether `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and
    * a check that answers differently in different ports is not a check.
    *
    * The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is
    * never more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address.
    * It ends the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also
    * breaks on `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this
    * does. It refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It
    * compares the host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on
