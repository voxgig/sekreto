// sekreto: one interface for secrets, wherever they live.
//
// A Sekreto is an ordered chain of providers. `get` asks each in turn and
// returns the first hit, so an app can be configured from environment
// variables in development and a vault in production without changing a
// line of its own code.
//
// THE CORE IMPORTS NO PLUGIN, IN ANY FORM. The four built-in kinds - env,
// memory, dotenv, file - read at most a local file; every other kind is a
// voxgig/plugin definition under `plugins/`, and a chain may name one only
// if the calling project handed it in through `plugins`. That is what keeps
// an SDK whose chain is `[dotenv, env]` from carrying AWS request signing
// and seven HTTP vault clients. Nothing in this package names
// `com.voxgig.sekreto.plugins`, the Makefile compiles `src/` with
// `plugins/` on neither the classpath nor the sourcepath, and
// `make check-core` proves it of the compiled artifact rather than of the
// source. See docs/design/plugin-providers.md.
//
// A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.
