/// dozen parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends,
/// whether `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and
/// a check that answers differently in different ports is not a check.

/// never more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address.
/// It ends the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also
/// breaks on `\` (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this
/// does. It refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It
/// compares the host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on
/// is refused rather than guessed at.
