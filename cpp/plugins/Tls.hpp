// The TLS binding, and the only file in this port that names OpenSSL.
//
// AGENTS.md rule 3 as a principle: cryptographic transport is not
// hand-rolled. Where a port's standard library has TLS it uses it; where
// it does not, it binds the platform's audited TLS library - the same one
// that language's own ecosystem binds. For C++ that is OpenSSL, reached
// directly rather than through Boost.Asio's SSL stream or cpp-httplib,
// because those bring an HTTP framing the rule requires in-tree.
//
// Audit surface: `-lssl -lcrypto`, and the distribution's OpenSSL is the
// audit surface. Nothing else is linked. Note in particular that
// libcrypto's own digests are NOT used for SigV4 - the exception covers
// transport only, so Crypto.cpp carries SHA-256 and HMAC in-tree, exactly
// as rust/src/crypto.rs does beside rustls.
