// A mini vault: every secret a project owns, encrypted, in ONE FILE.
//
// The store to reach for before there is a vault server. There is nothing
// to run and nothing to reach over a socket - the whole store is a single
// binary file - and the same chain that reads it in development reads
// HashiCorp or AWS in production by changing config, which is the reason
// sekreto exists.
//
// A PLUGIN, not a built-in: this kind needs crypto, which is the line the
// four built-in kinds stay behind. The calling project includes this
// header and passes what it declares to the Sekreto constructor
// (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
//
// A chain READS. Writing is a deliberate act with an API of its own, so
// the definition publishes `vault` beside `provider` and `vaultof` reads
// it back off the host - which is what this header is mostly for.
