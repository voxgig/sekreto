// Running another program, and the environment it inherits.

// Two of the ten kinds read a secret out of a CLI - boru and secretspec -
// and a child process is exactly the sort of thing the split exists to
// keep out of the core: `fork` and `execve` are one `#include` away in any
// C++ file, and a chain of built-ins must link neither.
//
// The argument list is passed as an array, never through a shell, and no
// secret is ever put on a command line where the process table publishes
// it.
