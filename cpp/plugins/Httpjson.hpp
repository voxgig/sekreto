// Just enough HTTP to ask a vault for a secret.
//
// C++ has no HTTP client in its standard library, so this speaks HTTP/1.1
// over a POSIX socket directly: a request with headers and an optional
// body, a status line, and a response body delimited by Content-Length, by
// chunks, or by the connection closing.
//
// The framing is in-tree deliberately. libcurl and cpp-httplib would both
// supply it, and both are HTTP clients rather than cryptographic transport
// - the one thing the dependency rule permits. So only the TLS half is
// bound out, and it is bound in Tls.cpp and nowhere else.
//
// It is not a general-purpose client: no redirect following, no
// keep-alive, no proxies, no client certificates. Each of those absences
// is load-bearing and the reasons are at their call sites.
//
// The shared transport of the plugins, and it is UNDER plugins/ for the
// reason the whole split exists: a chain of built-ins must never link an
// HTTP client, a TLS library or the socket beneath them.
//
// The percent-encoding and the base64 decoder live here rather than beside
// the SigV4 signer, because most of what needs them signs nothing: Azure,
// 1Password, Doppler and Infisical build query strings, and AWS and GCP
// decode payloads. Keeping them with the signer would put SHA-256 in the
// link map of every plugin that only ever speaks HTTP.
//
// A port of rust/src/http.rs.
