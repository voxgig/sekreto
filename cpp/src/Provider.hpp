// What a provider is, what its declarative form looks like, and how a
// provider kind becomes a voxgig/plugin definition.
//
// A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
// the value, or nothing to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
// provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
// `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
// .env file, HashiCorp Vault, AWS, GCP, Azure or a boru vault.
//
// A MISS is `std::nullopt` and a FAILURE is a thrown SekretoError. They
// are never interchangeable: a store that could not answer must not read
// as a store that does not hold the secret, or the chain falls quietly
// through to a weaker one.
//
// This is the bottom of the core: the error, the ordered map every spec
// and every signature is written in, the provider interface, the
// declarative form of a provider, and the bridge to voxgig/plugin. It
// includes nothing of sekreto's, which is what lets everything else
// include it.
//
// A port of typescript/src/provider/support.ts, which is canonical.

/// a class to extend and never a registry to fill.

/// with. A refusal is a thrown SekretoError.

/// provider it built. `Sekreto` reads `<ref>/provider` off the host.

/// The voxgig/plugin error code a SekretoError travels under when it is
/// thrown inside a definition's `define`.
///
/// plugin wraps a code-less error raised by a callback as
/// `plugin_define_failed`, and keeps an error that already carries a
/// code. A provider that refuses its own configuration - `kv: 3`, a
/// missing project - throws a SekretoError, and that message is pinned by
/// the spec byte for byte, so it must come back out of the host exactly
/// as it went in. `providerplugin` gives it this code on the way in;
/// `Sekreto` turns it back into a SekretoError on the way out.
extern const char* const ERROR_CODE;

/// A provider kind, as a voxgig/plugin definition.
///
/// This is the whole bridge between the two libraries. The definition's
/// `name` is the `kind` a ProviderSpec names; its `define` reads the spec
/// off the instance's options, builds the provider with `make`, and
/// exports it. Nothing runs at `activate`: a provider opens nothing until
/// its first lookup, so there is nothing to capture - a provider that does
/// hold a resource acquires it there and lets the instance scope unwind
/// it.
///
/// Every built-in and every plugin is made this way, so a custom provider
/// kind is one call:
///
///     Definition mystore = providerplugin(
///         "mystore", [](const ProviderSpec& spec) {
///           return std::make_shared<MyStore>(spec.addr);
///         });

/// that is set, named as the field is - the spec's own key names in every
/// port.

// --- the provider slots ----------------------------------------------

// voxgig/plugin's value model carries numbers, strings, lists and maps -
// not pointers - so a definition's `define` cannot export the provider it
// built. It leaves the provider HERE and exports the ticket; `Sekreto`
// reads the ticket back off the host and takes the provider, which empties
// the slot again. The same shape zig's port uses, for the same reason.
//
// A slot is claimed exactly once, so nothing accumulates: between two
// constructions the table is empty, and `providerslots()` says so. Two
// threads building chains at once would share it, and this port - like the
// plugin port under it - does not claim to support that.

/// Park a freshly built provider and answer its ticket.

/// Take the provider a ticket names, emptying the slot. Nothing, if the
/// ticket names no slot.

/// declaration fails after its `define` has already built something.

/// Drop every slot filled since `mark`.
