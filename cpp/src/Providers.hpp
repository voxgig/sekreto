// THE BUILT-IN PROVIDER KINDS - the same four in every port - and the
// address check every kind that dials one runs first.
//
// What makes a kind built in is that it needs nothing of the platform
// beyond reading a local file: no socket, no TLS, no crypto, no child
// process. These four are the floor every chain stands on, and a chain
// that reads secrets from options, the environment, a plaintext `.env` and
// a mounted secret directory works with no plugin loaded at all.
// Everything else - the vault clients, the cloud stores, the two CLIs, and
// SigV4 signing with them - is a voxgig/plugin definition and lives under
// `plugins/` (docs/design/plugin-providers.md).
//
// A port of typescript/src/provider/builtin.ts and
// typescript/src/provider/addr.ts, which are canonical.
