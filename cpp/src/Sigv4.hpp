// AWS Signature Version 4, hand-rolled.
//
// The AWS providers need exactly one thing from the AWS SDK - request
// signing - and taking the SDK for it would break the no-dependency rule
// that keeps the ports honest. SigV4 is a stable, published algorithm
// built from HMAC-SHA256, which Crypto.cpp supplies.
//
// `sigv4` is pure: the caller passes the timestamp, so the same input
// yields the same signature everywhere. That is what lets the shared spec
// carry known-answer cases all ports reproduce bit for bit, and lets the
// integration mock recompute the signature server-side. The clock is never
// sampled here.
//
// A port of typescript/plugins/sigv4.ts, which is canonical.
