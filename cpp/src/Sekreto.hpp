// sekreto: one interface for secrets, wherever they live.
//
// A Sekreto is an ordered chain of providers. `get` asks each in turn and
// returns the first hit, so an app can be configured from environment
// variables in development and a vault in production without changing a
// line of its own code.
//
// THE CORE INCLUDES NO PROVIDER THAT OPENS A SOCKET, SPAWNS A PROCESS OR
// SIGNS A REQUEST. The four built-in kinds - env, memory, dotenv, file -
// read at most a local file; every other kind is a voxgig/plugin
// definition under plugins/, and a chain may name one only if the calling
// project handed it in through `plugins`. That is what keeps an SDK whose
// chain is `[dotenv, env]` from linking AWS request signing, seven HTTP
// vault clients and OpenSSL behind them. See
// docs/design/plugin-providers.md.
//
// A port of typescript/src/Sekreto.ts, which is canonical.
