-- Address checking: core, never a plugin.
--
-- Every network provider routes its configured address through
-- `checkaddr` before a socket is opened, and every refusal names the
-- address through `safeaddr`.
--
-- The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every
-- port, rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate.
-- Twelve parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends,
-- whether `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and
-- a check that answers differently in different ports is not a check.
--
-- The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is
-- never more permissive than the transport that will dial the address.
-- It ends the authority at `/`, `?` or `#` only, so a client that also
-- breaks on `\` can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It
-- refuses userinfo outright rather than locating its end. It compares the
-- host literally, so a numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused
-- rather than guessed at.
