-- A mini vault: every secret a project owns, encrypted, in ONE FILE.
--
-- The store to reach for before there is a vault server. There is
-- nothing to run and nothing to reach over a socket - the whole store is
-- a single binary file - and the same chain that reads it in development
-- reads HashiCorp or AWS in production by changing config, which is the
-- reason sekreto exists.
--
-- A PLUGIN, not a built-in: this kind needs crypto, which is the line the
-- four built-in kinds stay behind. Lua 5.4's standard library has no
-- cryptography at all and the no-new-package rule stands, so the four
-- primitives come from the OpenSSL this port already links, through
-- `native/sekretovault.c` - a LOADABLE MODULE rather than a child
-- process, for the reason its header gives: a vault `list` over a hundred
-- secrets is a hundred AEAD opens, and a hundred spawns is not a store
-- anybody would use.
--
-- THE KEY DECIDES WHAT THE VAULT HOLDS. A master key reads and writes
-- every name and mints restricted keys. A restricted key reads the names
-- it was granted and CANNOT DERIVE ANY OTHER - the restriction is the
-- cryptography rather than a check this code performs, so a copy of the
-- file plus a restricted passphrase yields exactly what was granted and
-- nothing else. What that does and does not protect is set out in DOCS.md
-- under "What the mini vault protects".
--
-- THE FILE FORMAT, which is the contract between the ports:
--
--   magic       4   'SKMV'
--   version     1   FORMAT
--   kdf         1   1 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
--   cipher      1   1 = AES-256-GCM
--   reserved    1   0
--   keycount    4   uint32
--   per key:
--     id        1 + bytes      the key id, PLAINTEXT
--     salt      1 + bytes
--     iters     4              PBKDF2 rounds for this key
--     ring      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the passphrase
--     meta      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's meta key
--   entrycount  4   uint32
--   per entry:
--     id        1 + bytes      the blinded lookup id
--     name      1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under the vault's name key
--     value     1 + iv, 4 + bytes    sealed under that secret's own key
--
-- Integers are big-endian and every length precedes its bytes, so the
-- file is written with the same two primitives it is read with.
--
-- NOTHING OUTSIDE A KEY RECORD IS PLAINTEXT. Secret names are sealed, and
-- an entry is addressed by a blinded id derived from its own key, so a
-- restricted key finds what it was granted without the file ever naming
-- the rest. What the file does show anyone is the key ids and how many
-- secrets there are.
--
-- A port of typescript/plugins/minivault.ts, which is canonical. The
-- bytes are pinned by the vaults in test/fixture rather than left to
-- agreement between implementations.
