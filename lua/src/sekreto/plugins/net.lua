-- The bridge to the transport helper - a PLUGIN module, never the core.
--
-- Everything that opens a socket or starts a child process goes through
-- this file, so a chain of built-in kinds never requires it and never
-- needs native/sekretonet.c to have been built at all.
--
-- Lua cannot open a socket, and `io.popen` is unidirectional - so a
-- request cannot be written to a child and its answer read back through
-- the same handle. The request is therefore handed over in a file and the
-- answer comes back on the child's stdout.
--
-- The file, not the command line, because a vault token rides in the
-- request headers and the process table is world readable. It is created
-- by `os.tmpname`, which uses `mkstemp` and so is already 0600, and
-- native/sekretonet.c unlinks it before reading a byte of it.
--
-- Nothing about HTTP is known here. This module moves bytes, exactly as
-- the helper does - and it runs children, which is the other half of what
-- the helper is for.
